Put your dataset CSV here and rename it to `calories.csv` (or update paths in code).

Expected columns (any subset works; code is adaptive):
- Calories (target, required)
- Age, Weight, Height (cm or m), Duration (minutes), Heart_Rate (bpm), Body_Temp (Â°C)
- Optional: Gender (Male/Female), Exercise_Type (e.g., Running, Cycling), Steps, Distance
